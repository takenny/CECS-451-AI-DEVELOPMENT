6D state space (x1, y1) (x2, y2) (x3, y3) airports
objective function = sum of distance from each city to
                            (squared)
     it's nearest airport. Call it F value
    -f is our objective funciotn
        (xi - xc)^2 + (yi - yc)^2 <- xi , yi is coordinate for
         airport, xc,yc is coordinate for cities
        (SUM i=1 to 3 )(SUM all cities in ci ) (xi - xc)^2 + (yi - yc)^2
    c1 c2 c3 set of cities closest airport

gradiant gives maginitude and direction
gradiant is patial derivative of all 6 functions


minimize objective function follow negative slope
maximize objective function follow positive slope
